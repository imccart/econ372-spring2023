<p>For each Module, I have an “airport” idea. This is something I took from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Learning-legendary-Harvard-statistics-ebook/dp/B08P7TJZSQ">Invisible Learning</a>. An “airport” idea is something that is “so memorable, so deeply entrenched in your brain and how you view the world, that in five years’ time – when I see you at an airport – you will be able to explain those ideas to me even if you’ve forgotten everything else.” These are bigger than learning outcomes or learning objectives.</p>
<p>The airport idea for Module 0 is this: “Privatized health care introduces a web of complex incentives.” This does <strong>not</strong> say that privatized health care is bad, or that it is better or worse than fully public health care…just that using private prices to allocate resources in health care is complicated.</p>
<p>Below are our specific objectives, activities, and other resources for this introductory module.</p>

<h2>Slides</h2>
<p>The goal of this module is to answer the key questions that anyone should want answered when they start to learn something new, “what, why, who, and how?” That is, “what are we learning and why?” “who is learning it?” and “how are we going to learn it?” Why are you taking this class? What’s so interesting about health economics? Hopefully this part of our discussion convinces you how important and interesting health economics is.</p>
<p>Use the buttons below to open the slides either as an interactive website or as a static PDF (for printing or storing for later). You can also click in the embedded slides and navigate through them with your left and right arrow keys.</p>
<div class="fyi">
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: If you type <kbd>?</kbd> (or <kbd>shift</kbd> + <kbd>/</kbd>) while going through the slides, you can see a list of special slide-specific commands.</p>
