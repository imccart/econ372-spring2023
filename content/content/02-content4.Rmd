This final part of Module 2 concludes our discussion of physician agency. We'll talk about recent policy events including pay-for-performance and capitated payment models. We'll also discuss an academic paper in this area to help us practice reading and discussing this type of material.

## Objectives for this week
- Explain at least one recent hospital pay for performance program
- Identify and explain two pros and two cons from health care pay for performance models
- Define a capitated payment and describe at least one type of capitated payment currently in the U.S.
- Discuss the merits and drawbacks of a capitated payment model
