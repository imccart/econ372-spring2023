Part 1 of Module 1 is all about risk and uncertainty. We will eventually use these concepts to study insurance markets and premiums.

## Objectives
- Calculate expected values and expected utility
- Define a risk pool
- Define risk aversion and diminishing marginal utility
 
## Activities
- Discussion of Humana and importance of risk pools
- In-class example on expected values
- In-class problem on expected costs, expected utilities, and risk aversion. The worksheet is [here](/resource/wksheet1.html).
