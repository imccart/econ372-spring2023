<p>The narrow goal of this module is to understand hospital pricing, how we measure competition (in general, but also some specific aspects of health care markets), and how competition affects hospital/insurer negotiations.</p>
<p>The big picture economics concept of this module, or the “airport” idea that I hope you can remember several years later when we run into each other at the airport, is “profit matters, even for non-profits.” What does that mean? In the context of hospitals (the majority of which are designated as not-for-profit entities), it means that hospitals still have to make some money. As one CEO put it regularly in my past life, “there’s no mission without margin.”</p>
