<h2>Instructions</h2>
<p>This is our second homework assignment of the semester. It covers questions related to physician treatment decisions and asymmetric information. For some hints, take a look at these <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1hiZPH_dIAT5XatfQ6xaNkDiLc_JuXEjhiq4eNJugb14/edit?usp=sharing">supplemental homework 2 slides</a>.</p>

<h2>Theory Questions</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Assume a physician is operating with the standard profit function, <span class="math inline">\(\pi = (p-c)x\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> reflects a constant marginal cost of production, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> denotes quantity of healthcare provided, and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> denotes the price per unit of healthcare provided. Assume also that patients receive some total benefit from care received, reflected by the equation <span class="math inline">\(B(x)=20x - (1/2)x^{2}\)</span>. Patients must pay the full price, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, of any care received, so that the net benefit of care to the patient is then <span class="math inline">\(B(x)-px\)</span> (their total benefit less their costs). Finally, assume that the best outside option for the patient yields a net benefit of 0.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the patient were to choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to maximize their net benefit, what level of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would they choose?</p></li>
<li><p>Find the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. You need to solve this as a function of <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>At a marginal cost of <span class="math inline">\(c=6\)</span>, find the physician’s optimal price, <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare the physician’s profit maximizing choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to the patient’s optimal choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Are these the same? Why or why not?</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assume instead that the physician faces a fixed price, <span class="math inline">\(\bar{p}=8\)</span>. The setup is otherwise identical to question 1.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the patient were to choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to maximize their net benefit, what level of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> would they choose?</p></li>
<li><p>Again assuming <span class="math inline">\(c=6\)</span>, find the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Hint: marginal cost doesn’t matter here except to ensure that <span class="math inline">\(c&lt;\bar{p}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>How does the deviation in the physician and patient optima differ from what you found in question 1? Explain your answer in a couple of sentences.</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Assume now that the physician can affect the number of their patients through their influence on the net benefit (NB) provided to patients. Assume also that the physician faces a fixed price paid by the insurer, denoted <span class="math inline">\(p_{s}\)</span>, along with a capitated payment per patient, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, and that the patient faces a price of <span>$</span>0, <span class="math inline">\(p_{d}=0\)</span>. In this extension, the physician’s goal is to choose <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> so as to maximize profit, <span class="math display">\[\pi = n\left(NB\right) \left[R + (p_{s}-c)x \right].\]</span> Finally, assume the functional forms <span class="math inline">\(n(NB)=\sqrt{NB}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B(x)=10x-x^{2}\)</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Find the patient’s optimal level of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Find the first order condition for the physician’s choice of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Don’t try to solve this for <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that the physician makes <span>$</span>1 on each quantity of care provided (<span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=1\)</span>), find the value of the capitated payment, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, such that overtreatment is minimized. Please assume that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of overtreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.</p></li>
<li><p>Assuming that the physician loses <span>$</span>1 on each quantity of care provided (<span class="math inline">\(p_{s}-c=-1\)</span>), find the value of the capitated payment, <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>, such that undertreatment is minimized. Again, assume that <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of undertreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.</p></li>
<li><p>Which scenario (minimizing overtreatment or undertreatment) is better for the physician’s profit.</p></li>
</ul></li>

<h2>Empirical Questions</h2>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>In January 2014, CMS reduced it’s payments to physicians for epidural steroidal injections (CPT codes 62310, 62311, 62318, and 62319). The reduction was part of an effort to adjust “potentially misvalued services,” in which CMS lowered the payment rates back to 2013 levels. CMS subsequently increased the payment levels in 2015. Talk about whiplash! For this question, we’re going to use the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data from 2013 through 2015 to see how these payment changes may have affected the frequency of epidural steroidal injections. These data are available on our <strong>Canvas</strong> page…just look for the <strong>Data</strong> section on the main landing page. Take a look at the data in your favorite software, and answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How many unique physicians administered at least one epidural steroidal injection in 2013?</p></li>
<li><p>Among those physicians, what was the average number of injections in each year (2013 through 2015)? Use a graph to support your answer.</p></li>
<li><p>Among physicians with some injections in both 2013 and 2014, identify the physicians with the 10 largest reductions in injections from 2013 to 2014 (i.e., I want to see the physicians with the largest reductions, but exclude physicians that dropped to 0).</p></li>
<li><p>For the physicians identified in part 3, plot the number of injections for each physician over time (scatter plot with the count of injections on the vertical axis and year on the horizontal axis).</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>In January 2021, CMS changed its physician fee schedule, instituting relatively large increases for “Evaluation and Management” (E&amp;M, or just office visits) codes. <strong>But</strong>, due to budget neutrality requirements, such an increase required an offset for other services. Therefore, CMS also lowered the overall “conversion factor”. This made more expensive services in 2020 relatively less profitable, while payments for otherwise less expensive services were less affected (E&amp;M services, of course, actually increased in payment rate). For a decent discussion of these issues, see the “CMS Final Rule Discussion” on the Homework 2 page on <strong>Canvas</strong>. For this question, we’re going to again work with the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data available on <strong>Canvas</strong>. We’ll focus just on the 2018 data. We’ll also focus only on physicians in Georgia because the full data is a little too much to manage for this assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Identify a set of HCPCS codes that capture physician office visits. Do some internet digging first, just to see if you can find the codes that way. Ultimately, the best strategy is probably to identify the relevant codes based on the observed descriptions in the data.</p></li>
<li><p>Identify the physicians with the most (top 10) E&amp;M visits in 2018.</p></li>
<li><p>How much would these physicians from part B (the top 10 physicians) stand to gain from the increased RVU rate? Show your results in a table. You can see the percentage increases from the CMS Final Rule Discussion document on Canvas.</p></li>
<li><p>In the context of physician agency, what might you predict will happen to utilization of more expensive services after the 2021 fee schedule update?</p></li>
</ul></li>
