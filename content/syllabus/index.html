<h2>Course description</h2>
<p>This course examines the industrial organization of health care markets in the U.S., including underlying theory, empirical findings, and related health care policy. We will focus specifically on insurance markets, informational asymmetries between physicians and patients, and hospital pricing.</p>
<p><strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Economics 101 (Principles of Microeconomics). Some basic knowledge of calculus and derivatives is also required, but not necessarily the official Math 111 (Calculus I) course at Emory.</p>
</div>
<div id="learning-outcomes" class="section level2">
<h2>Learning outcomes</h2>
<p>The broad goal of the class is to understand the structure of health care markets in the U.S. The course is designed around three areas, reflecting the different interactions an individual would have when navigating the health care system — first choosing an insurance plan, then visiting a physician, and ultimately receiving hospital care. Our discussion of hospital care is further divided into issues of hospital objective functions, measuring hospital quality, and hospital competition. For each segment, we will develop the underlying theoretical model(s), cover recent empirical studies in the area, and discuss relevant health care policy. My specific goals are that, by the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Explain the structure of the U.S. health care system, its main components, and its history</p></li>
<li><p>Model adverse selection in health insurance, examine its effects on health insurance markets, and support your arguments with existing data</p></li>
<li><p>Explain the physician agency problem, use a model of physician agency to examine financial incentives in health care, and summarize empirical evidence on the presence of physician agency</p></li>
<li><p>Describe hospital pricing, negotiation with insurers, and explain (qualitatively and quantitatively) the differences between charges and prices</p></li>
<li><p>Analyze hospital data in a real-life setting and predict effects of real-life policies</p></li>
</ol>
<p>There are more specific learning outcomes for each module described on the relevant module’s section of the <a href="/content/">content page</a>.</p>

<h2>Course materials</h2>
<div id="where-to-go" class="section level3">
<h3>Where to go</h3>
<p>If you’re here, then you know where to find our class website. Well done! Hopefully it’s clear by the existence of the site that this is where I plan to host most of our information such as course materials, notes/slides, assignments. I’ll also use Canvas to distribute any papers or specific readings that aren’t available publicly, as well as post information that I don’t want public like virtual meeting passwords (if needed) and grades.</p>
</div>
<div id="readings" class="section level3">
<h3>Readings</h3>
<p>There are two recommended textbooks for this class. One is an intermediate microeconomics textbook that will cover much of the basic economic theory, and another is a health economics textbook. We will supplement these textbooks with other readings listed below in the detailed schedule, as well as online presentations, policy papers, and videos.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="citation">R. Pindyck and D. Rubinfeld <a href="#ref-pindyck2018" role="doc-biblioref"><em>Microeconomics</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2018)</a>.</span></li>
<li><span class="citation">Frank A Sloan and Chee-Ruey Hsieh <a href="#ref-sloan2012" role="doc-biblioref"><em>Health Economics</em>, vol. 1 (The MIT Press, 2012)</a>.</span></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="statistics-software" class="section level3">
<h3>Statistics software</h3>
<p>Each assignment will generally include both a theoretical and empirical section. Most of the empirical work involves basic summary statistics. This can be done in just about any spreadsheet or statistics package. I’ll use <code>R</code> for my work, but you are free to use whatever software you’re most comfortable with. I encourage you to use <code>R</code> or <code>Python</code> simply because these are the most common programs used in applied data analysis right now, but you can certainly use Excel or Google Sheets if you’d prefer. This is <strong>not</strong> a statistics or econometrics class, so I do not expect you to have any statistics programming knowledge.</p>
</div>
<div id="accessing-data" class="section level3">
<h3>Accessing data</h3>
<p>For all assignments and in-class activities, I will house all of the links to the data on our class website, and I’ll place the relevant datasets on Canvas. For transparency, I will also point you to other GitHub repositories where available. If you’re new to Git or GitHub and want to understand some of that better, take a look at <a href="https://grantmcdermott.com/">Grant McDermott’s</a> notes on <a href="https://github.com/uo-ec607/lectures">Data Science for Economists</a> as well as <a href="https://jennybryan.org/">Jenny Bryan’s</a> online reference book, <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/">Happy Git and GitHub with R</a>. But again, knowledge of Git or GitHub is not expected or required for this class.</p>
</div>
<div id="turning-things-in" class="section level3">
<h3>Turning things in</h3>
<p>All assignments should be submitted as PDF files on Canvas. Since we’ll be using some math in all of our answers, I suggest that assignments be completed through <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/">Overleaf</a>. As an Emory student, everyone has access to an institutional Overleaf account, which provides you with all the nice features of the product. You can use this to easily write PDF documents in a language known as “LaTeX”. For a brief introductory video and links to more info, please see the video <a href="https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Questions/Getting_started_with_LaTeX_and_Overleaf_(formerly_writeLaTeX)">here</a>. Overleaf is not a requirement, but I think it will save some you time in the long run. You are also welcome to use Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, etc., and convert to PDF for your final submission.</p>
<p>The only <strong>requirements</strong> are that your submission is a PDF and that your answers are legible and organized. Please <strong>DO NOT</strong> write tiny answers in margins of papers, scan as PDF, and submit. I will deduct some points for these types of submissions.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="course-policies" class="section level2">
<h2>Course policies</h2>
<p><strong>Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.</strong></p>
<p>Various policies for this course are described below. Basically, let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.</p>
<div id="class-meetings" class="section level3">
<h3>Class meetings</h3>
<p>All regular class meetings will take place in <strong>White Hall, Room 103</strong> on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30am to 12:45pm.</p>

<h3>Office hours</h3>
<p>My designated office hours will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1:30 to 2:30pm in R. Rollins, R432. I’m also available outside of these times. I just ask that you schedule an appointment in advance. <a href="https://mccarthy-meetings.youcanbook.me/">Make an appointment with me here.</a> While we call these “office hours” they really should be “student hours”. These are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. Take a look at this video for a more interesting presentation of what office hours really are and why you should come!</p>
