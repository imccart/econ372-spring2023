More details are available on the individual pages for each assignment. Please be sure to check the due dates on each assignment. Late assignments will receive an automatic 2% reduction in the grade for each day the assignment is turned in after the due date.\nHomework Please submit all of your homework answers as a PDF through Canvas. You can use Word and “print” to PDF, but I also encourage you to use Overleaf, which will help you to easily create PDFs and is much better for writing math-oriented documents. Overleaf is also fully cloud-based, and as an Emory student, you have full access to Overleaf Professional.\nThe only requirements for your submissions are: 1) they are submitted as PDFs; and 2) your answers are legible and organized. Please DO NOT write tiny answers in margins of papers, scan as PDF, and submit. I will deduct some points for these types of submissions, depending on how egregious it is.\nEach homework assignment is worth 60 points toward your final grade, consisting of 20 individual parts (think 4 or 5 questions each with 4 or 5 individual components). You should expect each part of each question to be worth 3 points. Each part will be graded as follows:\n3 points: Correct answer 2 points: Good try and close, but with minor mistakes 1 point: Incomplete work but an attempt nonetheless 0 points: No work toward the answer (e.g., completely blank or some initial equation written without any attempt to solve) All of the homework assignments have both a “theoretical” section and an “empirical” section. The empirical work is intended to meet two requirements: 1) it must be accessible and achievable for someone without a background in data analysis; and 2) it must involve real-world data. These two objectives are somewhat conflicting, but I’ve done my best to pre-clean the data so that things are simple on your end.\nThe empirical part of the assignments can be completed in any data software, including Excel. I also provide the data in R format if you’re familiar with that language. If you’d like a refresher on R or would like to give it a shot from scratch, take a look at some of the links on our resources page.\nExam We only have one exam this semester, and it will cover content from Modules 1 and 2. The exam is worth 60 points toward your final grade. Please see the Mid-term Exam page for more details.\nProject We do not have a final exam in this class. Instead, we have a final project that asks you to use real data and interpret some summary statistics in the context of the material we’ve covered in class. The final project is due on the date of our final exam, which is May 2nd this year. The project is worth 140 points toward your final grade.\nPlease see the Final Project for more details.\nParticipation “Participation” be graded based on how many of the individual participation elements are submitted. Throughout the semester, I will post “check-in” questionnaires on Canvas. I anticipate 6 check-ins total for the semester. Each check-in will ask questions about what you’ve learned in a given module so far, areas where you are confused, things that we do in class that you think are working, and things that we do in class that you think are not working. Completion of the check-in will provide 1 participation point.\nWe will also have regular in-class exercises. You can think of these as practice problems that we work on collectively as a class. Completing these exercises is also worth 1 participation point.\nAt the end of the semester, I will tally your participation points, and your final participation grade will be out of 20 possible participation points. We’ll have well over 20 total participation points available, so you have some margin for error here.\n","date":1641340800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"section","lang":"en","lastmod":1641340800,"objectID":"3aa23ffb1eb3dedbe4d8a9c2165e2c58","permalink":"/assignment/","publishdate":"2022-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/","section":"assignment","summary":"Homework Exam Project Participation Below are basic descriptions of each category of assignments for this semester.

So this is next period’s price.\nQuestion 3: What is the equilibrium price in this market?\nThe equlibrium price is such that insurers earn zero profits (under our assumptions). We can find that price by finding the quantity such that \\(AC=p\\). This occurs at \\(110 - 3q = 100 - 2q\\), or \\(q=10\\). The price at this quantity is 80. Note that the zero profit condition isn’t necessary to find an equilibrium in this way. We could easily incorporate some minimum “profit” per person by increasing the per unit costs in the cost function.\nQuestion 4: What if there is a $10 penalty imposed for those that do not purchase health insurance?\nThe penalty will effectively shift the demand curve out, as each individual is now willing to spend $10 more on health insurance. The new demand curve is then \\(120 - 3q\\). Setting this equal to the average cost curve yields \\(q=20\\). So a $10 penalty facilitates full insurance in this market.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"a2529b5dd23cfee99c13195a5b4d7771","permalink":"/resource/wksheet3/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/wksheet3/","section":"resource","summary":"Assume that the insurer’s cost function is given by \\(C=100q - 2q^{2}\\), where \\(q\\) denotes the number of people enrolled in the plan.

Finally, assume that the physician’s number of patients in their practice is governed by, \\(n(NB)=NB\\). The physician receives a fixed payment, \\(R\\), per patient, along with a margin of \\(p_{s}-c\\) for each unit of care, \\(x\\). The same amount of care \\(x\\) is provided to each patient.\nQuestion 1: What is the patient’s optimal amount of care?\nIf they could, the patient would choose \\(x\\) to maximize their net benefit, \\(B(x) - p_{d}x = 16x-2x^{2}\\). This net benefit is optimized at \\(x=4\\).\nQuestion 2: Write out the physician’s profit function.\nThe physician’s profit is simply their number of patients times the revenue per patient, \\(\\pi = n(NB) \\left[R + (p_{s}-c) \\right]\\). Given the functional forms provided in this question, we can rewrite this as, \\(\\pi = \\left(16x - 2x^{2}\\right) \\left(R + (p_{s}-c)x\\right)\\).\nQuestion 3: Find the physician’s optimal amount of care if \\(R=0\\) and \\(p_{s}-c=1\\)\nTo find the physician’s optimum, we must first take the derivative of the profit function and set this equal to 0, \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d}\\pi}{\\mathrm{d}x} = (16 - 4x)(R+ (p_{s}-c)x) + (p_{s}-c)(16x-2x^{2})=0\\).\nSetting \\(R=0\\) and \\(p_{s}-c=1\\), this reduces to \\((16-4x)x + 16x - 2x^{2} = 16x-4x^{2} + 16x - 2x^{2} = 32x-6x^{2}=0\\). Solving for \\(x\\) yields \\(x=5.33\\). This is larger than the patient’s optimal, \\(x=4\\), which should be expected since there is a positive FFS payment in this setup and no capitated payment.\nQuestion 4: Find the physician’s optimal amount of care if \\(R=1\\) and \\(p_{s}-c=1\\).\nPlugging these values into the same first order condition, we get \\((16-4x)(1+x) + 16x - 2x^{2} = 6x^{2} - 28x - 16=0\\). We can solve this with the quadratic equation, in which case \\(x = \\frac{28 \\pm \\sqrt(1168)}{12} \\approx (-0.515, 5.181)\\). Since we can’t provide negative care, we’ll take the positive root so that \\(x \\approx 5.181\\). While these numbers are small, the important part is that we’ve introduced a capitated payment \\(R=1\\) and managed to bring “overtreatment” down from 1.333 to 1.181. In other words, the inclusion of the capitated payment brought us closer to the patient’s optimal amount of care.\nQuestion 5: Find the physician’s optimal if \\(R=1\\) and \\(p_{s}-c=0\\).\nAgain substituting these values into he first order condition, we get \\((16-4x) = 0\\), or \\(x=4\\). So now the physician and patient optimal are the same value. Note that this is not a general solution…it only arises due to the linear patient function, \\(n(NB) = a*NB\\). For nonlinear functions, we won’t generally be able to easily obtain the same optimal values from the physician and patient’s perspective.

These basic tools are straightforward and easily mastered. In fact, you have already used calculus when you considered marginal revenue and marginal cost in your other economics classes. Here, I provide some review material to help you get back up-to-speed with the necessary mathematical concepts for this class.\nFunctions A function is just a formal way in which inputs (a functions arguments) are converted into an output. For example, a firm’s total revenue (TR) is a function of the amount they produce (Q), such that: \\[TR = TR(Q).\\] This means that total revenue depends on \\(Q\\), the quantity of product produced and sold. Total cost is also a function of \\(Q\\): \\[TC = TC(Q).\\]\nAs a more explicit example, suppose that the inverse demand for a firm is \\[P = 100 - 0.10Q,\\] where \\(P\\) denotes price and \\(Q\\) denotes quantity. Since total revenue is the product of price and quantity, we have \\[TR = P \\times Q = (100 - 0.10Q) \\times Q = 100Q - 0.10Q^2.\\] Thus, total revenue is a function of quantity produced and sold.\nSome functions are more complicated. Producing health care, for example, requires a hospital or some facility (\\(x_{1}\\)); lots of equipment and medical supplies (\\(x_{2}\\)); and physicians, nurses, and staff (\\(x_{3}\\)). We can write the production function of hospitals as \\[Q = f(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}),\\] where \\(Q\\) denotes the “amount” of health care provided and \\(f()\\) represents the production technology that converts inputs into outputs.\nSimple derivatives Marginal analysis involves analyzing the response of some outcome variable to a very small change in some other explanatory variable. Mathematically, these marginal effects are derivatives. For example, the derivative of \\(TR=TR(Q)\\) measures the rate of change in total revenue with respect to a small change in \\(Q\\). The derivative of a function is the slope of that function at a given point. By way of notation, we’ll write \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} TR}{\\mathrm{d} Q}\\) to represent the derivative of TR with respect to \\(Q\\). More generally, if \\(y=f(x)\\), then \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x}\\) is the derivative of \\(y\\) with respect to \\(x\\). We will also write this as \\(f\u0026#39;(x)\\).\nAs an example, consider the total revenue function, \\(TR = 100Q - 0.10Q^{2}\\). What is the derivative of the total revenue function at \\(Q=10\\)? Well, we know \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} TR}{\\mathrm{d} Q} = 100 - 0.20Q\\), so plugging in \\(Q=10\\) yields \\(98\\). So at a level of production of \\(Q=10\\), we know that our total revenue increases by 98 for one more unit produced.\nOptimization A common theme in all of economics is that firms and individuals optimize (i.e., maximize some objective function given their current information and constraints). In most simple cases, the optimum of a function occurs where the slope of that function (i.e., the first derivative) equals zero.\nFor example, suppose that total revenue is \\[TR = 100Q - 0.10Q^{2},\\] and assume that want to choose \\(Q\\) so as to maximize our total revenue (we’ll ignore costs for now). We can find this revenue-maximizing level of \\(Q\\) by taking the derivative and setting it equal to 0, \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} TR}{\\mathrm{d} Q} = 100 - 0.20Q.\\] In other words, we know that the function is maximized when the derivative is 0, so we’re going to find the level of \\(Q\\) where that condition is satisfied. In our case, that is for \\(Q\\) such that \\(100 - 0.20Q=0\\), or \\(Q=500\\). So a quantity of 500 maximizes total revenue.\nRules of differentiation There are several rules, or shortcuts, for finding derivatives of common functional forms. These rules are mechanical, but they are useful to remember and only require some basic alebra.\nThe derivative of a constant is 0\nThe power rule\nConsider the function, \\(y=f(x)=x^{n}\\). The derivative of \\(y\\) is \\(f\u0026#39;(x) = n x^{n-1}\\). For example:\nIf \\(y=x^{3}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = 3x^{2}\\).\nIf \\(y=x^{-2}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = -2x^{-3}\\).\nIf \\(y=x\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = x^{0} = 1\\).\nConstant multiples Let \\(k\\) be any constant. Then if \\(y=k x^{n}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = n k x^{n-1}\\). For example:\nIf \\(y=2x^{4}\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = 8x^{3}\\). If \\(y=-2x\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = -2\\) The sum and difference rule Let \\(y=f(x) + g(x)\\). Then the derivative of \\(y\\) is just the sum of the derivatives of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). Similarly, the derivative of \\(y=f(x) - g(x)\\) is the difference of the derivatives of \\(f(x)\\) and \\(g(x)\\). We just differentiate one term at a time.\nProduct rule If \\(y=f(x) \\times g(x)\\), then ther derivative is \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = f(x) \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} g(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x} + g(x) \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} f(x)}{\\mathrm{d} x}.\\] In words, this is \"the derivative of the first times the second plus the derivative of the second times the first. For example:\nIf \\(y=(3x^{2} + 5)(x^{2}+1)\\), the derivative is \\(\\frac{\\mathrm{d} y}{\\mathrm{d} x} = 6x \\times (x^{2} + 1) + 2x \\times (3x^{2} + 5)\\).\nChain rule We use the chain rule when our dependent variable is a function of another function. For example, revenue is a function of \\(Q\\), which in turn may be a function of production inputs. Suppose that our short-run production function is \\(Q=Q(L)\\), where \\(L\\) is quantity of labor. The firm faces an inverse demand function, \\(P=P(Q)\\), such that revenue is \\[TR = P(Q) \\times Q(L).\\] So revenue is a function of \\(Q\\), which is itself a function of \\(L\\).\nTo find the derivative with respect to \\(L\\), we differentiate \\(P(Q) \\times Q\\) using the product rule, and then multiply the result by the derivative of \\(Q\\) with respect to \\(L\\): \\[\\frac{\\mathrm{d} TR}{\\mathrm{d} L} = \\left(P(Q) + Q \\times \\frac{\\mathrm{d} P(Q)}{\\mathrm{d} Q} \\right) \\frac{\\mathrm{d} Q}{\\mathrm{d} L}.\\]\nPartial derivatives If \\(y=f(x,z)\\), then we may want to know how changes in one of the independent variables affects the outcome while holding the remaining independent variables constant. This is what a partial derivative does. Essentially, you take the usual derivative, treating all of the other variables as constants. So all of the rules above apply here as well. For example, say we have \\(y=3x^{2} + xz + 4z^{2}\\), then \\[\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial x} = 6x + z,\\] and \\[\\frac{\\partial y}{\\partial z} = x + 8z.\\]\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"760cb6ebe5f430657c13189ca51dc1bb","permalink":"/resource/review1/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/review1/","section":"resource","summary":"Throughout the course, we’ll use a handful of elementary concepts from calculus.

This essentially replaces what would otherwise be a final exam. Please start as early as possible and save yourself lots of stress in May!\nOverview Hospital price transparency is an important topic and one that has been at the forefront of health policy debates for many years. Recently, CMS mandated that hospitals provide their negotiated payment rates in a “machine-readable” format for patients to be able to see actual hospital prices for selected procedures. For more info on the initiative, see here.\nBuilding off of this new policy, this project is all about hospital “prices”. There are three main elements of the project:\nCombine data on hospital prices with information on Medicare payment rates and hospital charges for specific procedures Examine “compliance” with the transparency policies Discuss the differences between different measures of “price” Examine the relationship between hospital market power and compliance, and the relationship between market power and prices (where available) Project Details Your project analysis should proceed with the following steps:\nSelect your markets: First, select 10 hospital markets in the U.S. that you would like to study. You can find a list of hospital markets on the shared Google Sheet, econ372-hospital-markets, on the Markets tab. Put your name by the markets you’d like to study. If someone has already selected your market, just add another column for your name.\nOrganize pricing data: Construct a dataset consisting of the hospital information and hospital prices among all hospitals in your selected markets. A dataset on hospital characteristics and a dataset on hospital prices will be made available on Canvas. You will need to combine these data and focus only on the markets you selected in step 1. Note that, if a hospital price is missing from the pricing data, then that hospital can be considered as “non-compliant” (i.e., they did not make their pricing data publicly available as mandated).\nCollect other payment data: Collect data on Medicare payment rates and charges for the same hospitals and same procedures. These data are often provided as part of the same machine-readable file you found earlier, but if not, Medicare payments and charges are also publicly available from the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Inpatient files. Focus on the 2019 data.\nCombine your data: Select five DRG codes that you’d like to study in more detail, and create a dataset that contains data from 2 and 3. In these data, each row should be a hospital/procedure pair, and the columns should include information such as: “hospital ID”; “DRG code”; “gross charge”; “Medicare payment”; “compliance”; and “negotiated payment” (if the hospital is compliant). Save your dataset as a “.csv” file and include it as part of your project submission on Canvas.\nSummarize the data: Based on your combined dataset, provide a table of summary values for each market and each DRG code. For example, your table could show the mean charge and payments, as well as the count of hospitals that are compliant.\nSummarize the data for a specific procedures: Select a single DRG code to study. Calculate the range of negotiated prices in each market for this DRG code and show these ranges in a figure.\nThink about your data: Highlight one interesting aspect of your data and discuss this in your report. Support your discussion with at least one figure or table. You get to choose what is “interesting” here.\nExamine pricing and competition: Now let’s think about how these pricing figures relate to competition. Calculate each hospital’s market share and provide a scatterplot of the market share and negotiated payments. Do this for just one procedure (whatever procedure you’d like to focus on). In your figure, please highlight the different hospitals in some way (e.g., use different colors for each hospital or different shapes for each plot). Note: to calculate market share, you may need to collect more data, such as data on total discharges. These are available from the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data: Inpatient files.\nExamine compliance and competition: Finally, let’s think about how hospital compliance is related to competition and market power. Is there anything common among hospitals that you find to be non-compliant?\nReflection: Reflect on your work. Describe one thing you learned from this process and one area that left you confused or unclear. Given your analysis and your experience collecting these data, do you think the price transparency initiative will help to reduce hospital prices?\nFormatting and Report Structure As with your homework assignments, you will turn in your project via Canvas. Your final project must meet the following basic formatting requirements:\nFormat: Double-spaced text with clearly defined section headings and subheadings Length: At least 3 and no more than 8 pages, excluding references, tables, or figures Data Visualization: At least one table and one figure Please organize your final report along the following sections:\nDescription of your selected market and hospitals: Relates to Q1 in Project Details Hospital prices, charges, and Medicare payments: Relates to Q2-Q7 in Project Details Pricing and competition: Relates to Q8 in Project Details Compliance and competition: Relates to Q9 in Project Details Summary and conclusions: Relates to Q10 in Project Details Grading Criteria Your final project grade is based off of 140 points as allocated below. Components worth 5 points will be graded in single point increments. All other components will be graded in 5 point increments. For example, the “Discussion of Payments” component can receive credit of 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 points. This rubric is designed to ensure grading is fair across all students, as it is nearly impossible to discern single-point differences in credit for long-answer questions, figures, etc.\nFollow instructions (10 points): Does your report meet the requirements for length, formatting, and data visualization? Grammar (5 points): Does your report have sufficiently few grammatical mistakes, typos, etc.? Complete data (15 points): Did you create and submit the final dataset as described in Q4 in Project Details? Data summary (20 points): Did you summarize your data as described in Q5 and Q6 in Project Details? Discussion of payments (20 points): Did you discuss your pricing data as described in Q7 in Project Details? Payments and competition (25 points): Did you incorporate and summarize data on hospital market power and prices as described in Q8 in Project Details? Compliance and competition (25 points): Did you discuss your findings related to compliance and competition as described in Q9 in Project Details? Reflection (20 points): Did you reflect on your work as described in Q10 in Project Details?

It covers questions related to physician treatment decisions and asymmetric information. For some hints, take a look at these supplemental homework 2 slides.\nTheory Questions Assume a physician is operating with the standard profit function, \\(\\pi = (p-c)x\\), where \\(c\\) reflects a constant marginal cost of production, \\(x\\) denotes quantity of healthcare provided, and \\(p\\) denotes the price per unit of healthcare provided. Assume also that patients receive some total benefit from care received, reflected by the equation \\(B(x)=20x - (1/2)x^{2}\\). Patients must pay the full price, \\(p\\), of any care received, so that the net benefit of care to the patient is then \\(B(x)-px\\) (their total benefit less their costs). Finally, assume that the best outside option for the patient yields a net benefit of 0.\nIf the patient were to choose \\(x\\) to maximize their net benefit, what level of \\(x\\) would they choose?\nFind the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, \\(x\\). You need to solve this as a function of \\(c\\).\nAt a marginal cost of \\(c=6\\), find the physician’s optimal price, \\(p\\).\nCompare the physician’s profit maximizing choice of \\(x\\) to the patient’s optimal choice of \\(x\\). Are these the same? Why or why not?\nAssume instead that the physician faces a fixed price, \\(\\bar{p}=8\\). The setup is otherwise identical to question 1.\nIf the patient were to choose \\(x\\) to maximize their net benefit, what level of \\(x\\) would they choose?\nAgain assuming \\(c=6\\), find the physician’s profit maximizing choice of quantity, \\(x\\). Hint: marginal cost doesn’t matter here except to ensure that \\(c\u0026lt;\\bar{p}\\).\nHow does the deviation in the physician and patient optima differ from what you found in question 1? Explain your answer in a couple of sentences.\nAssume now that the physician can affect the number of their patients through their influence on the net benefit (NB) provided to patients. Assume also that the physician faces a fixed price paid by the insurer, denoted \\(p_{s}\\), along with a capitated payment per patient, \\(R\\), and that the patient faces a price of $0, \\(p_{d}=0\\). In this extension, the physician’s goal is to choose \\(x\\) so as to maximize profit, \\[\\pi = n\\left(NB\\right) \\left[R + (p_{s}-c)x \\right].\\] Finally, assume the functional forms \\(n(NB)=\\sqrt{NB}\\) and \\(B(x)=10x-x^{2}\\).\nFind the patient’s optimal level of \\(x\\).\nFind the first order condition for the physician’s choice of \\(x\\). Don’t try to solve this for \\(x\\).\nAssuming that the physician makes $1 on each quantity of care provided (\\(p_{s}-c=1\\)), find the value of the capitated payment, \\(R\\), such that overtreatment is minimized. Please assume that \\(x\\) can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of overtreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.\nAssuming that the physician loses $1 on each quantity of care provided (\\(p_{s}-c=-1\\)), find the value of the capitated payment, \\(R\\), such that undertreatment is minimized. Again, assume that \\(x\\) can only take discrete values, so that the minimum amount of undertreatment is 1 “unit of care” per patient.\nWhich scenario (minimizing overtreatment or undertreatment) is better for the physician’s profit.\nEmpirical Questions In January 2014, CMS reduced it’s payments to physicians for epidural steroidal injections (CPT codes 62310, 62311, 62318, and 62319). The reduction was part of an effort to adjust “potentially misvalued services,” in which CMS lowered the payment rates back to 2013 levels. CMS subsequently increased the payment levels in 2015. Talk about whiplash! For this question, we’re going to use the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data from 2013 through 2015 to see how these payment changes may have affected the frequency of epidural steroidal injections. These data are available on our Canvas page…just look for the Data section on the main landing page. Take a look at the data in your favorite software, and answer the following questions:\nHow many unique physicians administered at least one epidural steroidal injection in 2013?\nAmong those physicians, what was the average number of injections in each year (2013 through 2015)? Use a graph to support your answer.\nAmong physicians with some injections in both 2013 and 2014, identify the physicians with the 10 largest reductions in injections from 2013 to 2014 (i.e., I want to see the physicians with the largest reductions, but exclude physicians that dropped to 0).\nFor the physicians identified in part 3, plot the number of injections for each physician over time (scatter plot with the count of injections on the vertical axis and year on the horizontal axis).\nIn January 2021, CMS changed its physician fee schedule, instituting relatively large increases for “Evaluation and Management” (E\u0026amp;M, or just office visits) codes. But, due to budget neutrality requirements, such an increase required an offset for other services. Therefore, CMS also lowered the overall “conversion factor”. This made more expensive services in 2020 relatively less profitable, while payments for otherwise less expensive services were less affected (E\u0026amp;M services, of course, actually increased in payment rate). For a decent discussion of these issues, see the “CMS Final Rule Discussion” on the Homework 2 page on Canvas. For this question, we’re going to again work with the Medicare Provider Utilization and Payment Data available on Canvas. We’ll focus just on the 2018 data. We’ll also focus only on physicians in Georgia because the full data is a little too much to manage for this assignment.\nIdentify a set of HCPCS codes that capture physician office visits. Do some internet digging first, just to see if you can find the codes that way. Ultimately, the best strategy is probably to identify the relevant codes based on the observed descriptions in the data.\nIdentify the physicians with the most (top 10) E\u0026amp;M visits in 2018.\nHow much would these physicians from part B (the top 10 physicians) stand to gain from the increased RVU rate? Show your results in a table. You can see the percentage increases from the CMS Final Rule Discussion document on Canvas.\nIn the context of physician agency, what might you predict will happen to utilization of more expensive services after the 2021 fee schedule update?\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"7e68ce5d8891c59fe90ac99fea926a07","permalink":"/assignment/homework2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/assignment/homework2/","section":"assignment","summary":"Instructions This is our second homework assignment of the semester.

Answer the following questions based on this setup.\nQuestion 1: Calculate the risk premium and willingness to pay based on a probability of illness of 0.1.\nTo find the risk premium, we first need to calculate the expected utility: \\(E[u]=0.1*\\ln(50) + 0.9*\\ln(100)=\\) 4.536. Next, we need to find the monetary value that provides this same level of utility. So we need \\(y\\) such that \\(u(y)=\\) 4.536. Since our utility function is \\(\\ln(x)\\), we know that \\(y =\\) exp(4.536) \\(=\\) 93.3. The risk premium is then the difference between this value and our starting wealth (less the expected cost of care), \\(\\pi =\\) 100 - 93.3 - 5 \\(=\\) 1.697.\nQuestion 2: Repeat part (1) using a probability of illness of 0.2.\nRepeating that same process yields an expected utility of 4.467. The monetary value that provides this level of utility with certainty is \\(y =\\) exp(4.467) \\(=\\) 87.06. The risk premium is then the difference between this value and our starting wealth (less the expected cost of care), \\(\\pi =\\) 100 - 87.06 - 10 \\(=\\) 2.945.\nQuestion 3: Repeat part (1) using a probability of illness of 0.5.\nRepeating that same process yields an expected utility of 4.259. The monetary value that provides this level of utility with certainty is \\(y =\\) exp(4.259) \\(=\\) 70.71. The risk premium is then the difference between this value and our starting wealth (less the expected cost of care), \\(\\pi =\\) 100 - 70.71 - 25 \\(=\\) 4.289.\nQuestion 4: Explain how these values differ and why. What might this say about the profitability of insurance in a market with many sick people?\nWe see from these examples that the risk premium is increasing as the amount of uncertainty increases. If people are more certain about being ill, then the risk premium is lower. This means that people are unwilling to pay much more than the expected cost of care, leaving less potential profit for insurers.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"30ef5629f31cf8cedef65097cb071c33","permalink":"/resource/wksheet2/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/wksheet2/","section":"resource","summary":"Assume that utility takes the log form, \\(u(x)=ln(x)\\).

This material mirrors that of our homework assignments and in-class problems, but this is just for some extra practice. Answers are included below each question, but please try to answer the questions on your own first!\nMath Problems Question 1 Assume your utility function is \\(u(w)=\\sqrt{w}\\), and you begin with wealth of \\(w=\\) $100. I propose a lottery in which I flip a coin. If the coin turns up heads, you win $30. If the coin turns up tails, you lose $30. What’s the expected monetary value of this lottery? What is your utility at this expected value? What’s the expected utility from this lottery? In one sentence, explain why your answer in part (c) differs from part (b). Answers Expected wealth is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\times 70 + \\frac{1}{2} \\times 130 = 100\\). At the wealth value of $100, \\(u(100)=\\sqrt{100}=10\\). Expected utility is \\(\\frac{1}{2} \\times \\sqrt{70} + \\frac{1}{2}\\times \\sqrt{130} = 9.88.\\) If you choose this lottery, you are entering into a risky scenario, and so your expected utility is lower than if you were to receive the same expected monetary value of the lottery ($100) with certainty. Question 2 Consider the utility function, \\(u(w)=\\ln(w)\\). Assume an individual starts with wealth of $50,000. With probability 0.6, this person will get sick and incur a cost of $10,000.\nWhat is the expected utility and expected wealth in this situation? What is the risk premium? What is the maximum amount this person is willing to pay for health insurance? What happens to the risk premium if the probability of illness decreases by 0.05? Explain in one sentence. Answers Expected utility is \\(E[u(w)]=0.6 \\times \\ln (40000) + 0.4 \\times \\ln (50000) = 10.686\\) and expected wealth is \\(E[w]=0.6 \\times 40000 + 0.4 \\times 50000 = 44,000\\). The monetary value that provides a level of utility equal to expected utility in this case is \\(u^{-1}\\left(E[u(w)]\\right) = u^{-1}(10.686) = e^{10.686} \\approx 43,740.\\) The risk premium is then \\(\\pi = 44000-43740=260\\). This is just the risk premium ($260) plus the expected cost of care ($6,000). So they are willing to pay up to $6,260 for health insurance (i.e., this is the price at which they would be indifferent between purchasing or not purchasing health insurance). In this case, a decrease in the probability of illness will increase the uncertainty since we’re starting at a probability of 0.6. So this would lead to an increase in the risk premium and a decrease in the maximum willingness to pay for health insurance. Question 3 Assume an insurer’s cost function is given by \\(C=100q - 2q^{2}\\), where \\(q\\) denotes the number of people enrolled in the plan. Further assume that demand is given by \\(D=120-3q\\). The total size of the population is \\(N=40\\).\nWhat is the equilibrium price if the insurer earns $0 profit? At this equilibrium price, how many people in this market are uninsured? The government is considering providing a fixed dollar subsidy per person. Find the smallest possible subsidy such that all individuals purchase health insurance. Answers The equilibrium price will be at the point were \\(p=D=AC\\). In this case, \\(AC=\\frac{100q - 2q^{2}}{q} = 100-2q.\\) Setting this equal to demand, \\(120-3q = 100-2q\\), so \\(q=20\\). Plugging this back into the demand function shows that \\(q=20\\) will occur at a \\(p=120-3q=120-3\\times 20=60\\). We know that the equilibrium quantity is \\(q=20\\), and that the total number of people in the market is \\(N=40\\). So 20 individuals remain uninsured. The key here is to start with the graph and recognize what a fixed dollar subsidy per person amounts to just a shift in the demand curve (i.e., a change in the intercept and not a change in the slope). If we are trying to have everyone insured, then this fixed subsidy must be such that the demand curve intersects with the AC curve only at \\(N=40\\). At \\(q=40\\), we know that \\(AC=100-2q=20\\). So we need to provide a subsidy such that quantity demanded is 40 and a price of $20. Turning back to the demand curve, and denoting the subsidy by \\(s\\), we need to find \\(s\\) such that \\(20=120+s-3\\times 40\\) (this tells us \\(s\\) to satisfy \\(D=40\\) at \\(p=20\\)). This means that \\(s=20\\), so we need to give everyone a $20 subsidy to buy health insurance if we want everyone in this market to be insured. Question 4 Consider a physician or physician practice that sets quantity of care, \\(x\\), and price, \\(p\\), to maximize profits subject to providing at least enough net benefit to meet a patient’s best outside option. Assume that the patient receives benefit from care according to the benefit function, \\(B(x)=20x-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\). Further assume that \\(NB^{0}=36\\) and \\(c=2\\), and that the patient pays the full price of care.\nFind the physician’s optimal \\(x\\) and \\(p\\). Find the patient’s optimal level of care, \\(x\\). What happens to the amount of overtreatment if \\(NB^{0}\\) decreases from 36 to 18 (i.e., the patient has a less viable outside option)? Answers The physician’s problem is to maximize \\(px - cx\\) subject to the constraint that \\(B(x)-px=NB^{0}\\). Rewriting the constraint as \\(px=B(x)-NB^{0}\\), we can first find the physician’s optimal choice of \\(x\\) as that which maximizes \\(B(x)-NB^{0}-cx = 20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - 36 - 2x\\). Taking the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) and setting equal to 0 yields, \\(20-x-2=0\\), or \\(x^{*}=18\\). We can then find the price by substituting this level of \\(x\\) into the constraint, so that \\(p=\\frac{1}{x} \\times \\left( B(x) - NB^{0}\\right) = \\frac{1}{x} \\times \\left(20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - 36 \\right) = 20-9-2=9\\). So the physician sets \\(p^{*}=9\\) and \\(x^{*}=18\\). The patient simply wants to maximize their net benefit, \\(B(x)-px=20x-\\frac{1}{2}x^{2}-px\\). Again taking the derivative with respect to \\(x\\) and setting equal to 0 yields \\(20-x-p=0\\) or \\(x=20-p\\). At \\(p^{*}=9\\), the patient’s optimal level of care is then \\(\\bar{x}=11\\). A decrease in \\(NB^{0}\\) doesn’t change the physician’s first order conditions, and so the physician’s optimal level of care is the same at \\(x^{*}=18\\). But the price now changes because the physician can increase price and still maintain a net benefit equal to the patient’s best outside option. Specifically, the price now increases to \\(p=20-\\frac{1}{2}x - \\frac{18}{x} = 10\\). At this price, the patient’s optimal level of care is \\(\\bar{x}=20-p=10\\). So the amount of overtreatment increased, from 7 units of care to 8. Question 5 Assume that the physician instead faces an administratively set price of \\(\\bar{p}\\) and that the best outside option is \\(NB^{0}=0\\). Maintain the assumption that \\(B(x)=20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\).\nFind the physician’s optimal quantity of care as a function of \\(\\bar{p}\\). How does the physician’s choice of \\(x\\) change with \\(\\bar{p}\\)? If we think of physician services as just a supply curve, is the direction of this relationship surprising or as expected? Answers In this case, the physician simply sets \\(x\\) as high as possible (assuming \\(\\bar{p}\u0026gt;c\\)). The only thing restricting the physician from increasing \\(x\\) is the constraint on net benefit, so to find \\(x\\) we just rewrite the net benefit constraint \\(\\bar{p}x = 20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} - NB^{0} = 20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}.\\) We can rewrite this further such that \\(\\bar{p} = \\frac{1}{x}\\times \\left(20x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2} \\right) = 20-\\frac{1}{2}x\\). Finally, solving for \\(x\\) instead of \\(\\bar{p}\\), yields \\(x^{*} = 2 (20-\\bar{p})\\). An increase in \\(\\bar{p}\\) will lead to a decrease in \\(x^{*}\\), which is surprising compared to a traditional supply curve but not surprising in the context of this model where physicians set the choice of care. Note that this result only applies because we assume that patients pay \\(\\bar{p}\\) for each unit of care received. If physicians received a higher price and the patient’s out of pocket costs were unchanged, then this would lead to no change in the quantity of care and higher profits for the physician. Essentially, the physician is only restricted by the patient’s net benefit, so if the price to the patient increases, the physician must provide less care otherwise the patient would leave the practice and take their outside option. Question 6 Assume a physician is operating with the profit function, \\[\\pi = NB \\left[R + (p_{s}-c)x \\right],\\] where \\(NB=B(x) - p_{d}x\\), \\(p_{s}\\) denotes the (fixed) price paid by the insurer to the physician, \\(p_{d}\\) denotes the (fixed) price paid by the patient, \\(R\\) denotes the capitated payment per patient, \\(NB\\) denotes the net benefit to the patient, and \\(x\\) denotes the quantity of care per patient.\nAssuming \\(B(x) = 5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}\\), \\(p_{d}=0\\), \\(p_{s}-c=1\\), and \\(R=2\\), find the physician’s optimal level of \\(x\\). Compare the amount in part (a) with the patient’s optimal. Is this a scenario of overtreatment or undertreatment? Assume instead that the government sets \\(R=3\\). Does this increase or decrease the amount of overtreatment? Show your answer. Answers In this setup, the profit function is \\(\\pi = (5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2})(2+x)\\). Differentiating with respect to \\(x\\) yields \\((5 - x)(2 + x) + (5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2})\\). Expanding the first term, we get \\[10 + 5x - 2x - x^{2} + 5x - \\frac{1}{2}x^{2}=0.\\] Rearranging and combining terms then gives us \\(-\\frac{3}{2}x^{2} + 8x + 10=0\\). We can solve this using the quadratic formula, \\(x=\\frac{-8 \\pm \\sqrt{64 + 4 (3/2) (10)}}{-3} \\approx \\left( \\frac{8-11.1}{3}, \\frac{8+11.1}{3}\\right)\\). The positive solution is approximately \\(x^{*} \\approx 6.4\\). The patient wants to maximize their net benefit, which in this case is \\(B\u0026#39;(x)=0\\), or \\(5 - x = 0\\). So the patient would choose \\(\\bar{x}=5\\). The physician’s choice of \\(x^{*}\\approx 6.4\\) therefore represents overtreatment. At \\(R=3\\), the first order condition becomes \\(-\\frac{3}{2}x^{2} + 7x + 15 = 0\\). We can again solve this using the quadratic formula, \\(x=\\frac{-7 \\pm \\sqrt{49 + 4 (3/2) (15)}}{-3} \\approx \\left( \\frac{7-11.8}{3}, \\frac{7+11.8}{3}\\right)\\). The positive solution is approximately \\(x^{*} \\approx 6.3\\). Overtreatment has therefore decreased, which should be the case as we shift the incentive more toward the capitated payment and away from the fee-for-service payment. Graphs I expect you to be able to draw a graph supporting many of the calculations (e.g., a graph reflecting the risk premium, adverse selection and unravelling, or the physician’s choice of \\(x\\) relative to the patient’s optimum). The graph doesn’t need to necessarily fit any specific functional forms - it just needs to reflect the structure of the problem. For example, I don’t care if you correctly draw the square root function versus the natural log - just that you can show how the expected utility line differs from the utility curve and where the risk premium is reflected in such a graph.\nPublished Papers The exam will also include 1 or 2 questions related to a new paper that you must read closely and summarize as part of the exam.

If a firm’s profit function is \\(\\pi = (80-Q)Q - 10Q\\), what quantity will maximize the firm’s profit? What is the price at this level of \\(Q\\) (hint: inverse demand is the same as in part 1)?

We will focus specifically on insurance markets, informational asymmetries between physicians and patients, and hospital pricing.\nPrerequisites: Economics 101 (Principles of Microeconomics). Some basic knowledge of calculus and derivatives is also required, but not necessarily the official Math 111 (Calculus I) course at Emory.\nLearning outcomes The broad goal of the class is to understand the structure of health care markets in the U.S. The course is designed around three areas, reflecting the different interactions an individual would have when navigating the health care system — first choosing an insurance plan, then visiting a physician, and ultimately receiving hospital care. Our discussion of hospital care is further divided into issues of hospital objective functions, measuring hospital quality, and hospital competition. For each segment, we will develop the underlying theoretical model(s), cover recent empirical studies in the area, and discuss relevant health care policy. My specific goals are that, by the end of this course, you will be able to:\nExplain the structure of the U.S. health care system, its main components, and its history\nModel adverse selection in health insurance, examine its effects on health insurance markets, and support your arguments with existing data\nExplain the physician agency problem, use a model of physician agency to examine financial incentives in health care, and summarize empirical evidence on the presence of physician agency\nDescribe hospital pricing, negotiation with insurers, and explain (qualitatively and quantitatively) the differences between charges and prices\nAnalyze hospital data in a real-life setting and predict effects of real-life policies\nThere are more specific learning outcomes for each module described on the relevant module’s section of the content page.\nCourse materials Where to go If you’re here, then you know where to find our class website. Well done! Hopefully it’s clear by the existence of the site that this is where I plan to host most of our information such as course materials, notes/slides, assignments. I’ll also use Canvas to distribute any papers or specific readings that aren’t available publicly, as well as post information that I don’t want public like virtual meeting passwords (if needed) and grades.\nReadings There are two recommended textbooks for this class. One is an intermediate microeconomics textbook that will cover much of the basic economic theory, and another is a health economics textbook. We will supplement these textbooks with other readings listed below in the detailed schedule, as well as online presentations, policy papers, and videos.\nR. Pindyck and D. Rubinfeld Microeconomics (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2018). Frank A Sloan and Chee-Ruey Hsieh Health Economics, vol. 1 (The MIT Press, 2012). Statistics software Each assignment will generally include both a theoretical and empirical section. Most of the empirical work involves basic summary statistics. This can be done in just about any spreadsheet or statistics package. I’ll use R for my work, but you are free to use whatever software you’re most comfortable with. I encourage you to use R or Python simply because these are the most common programs used in applied data analysis right now, but you can certainly use Excel or Google Sheets if you’d prefer. This is not a statistics or econometrics class, so I do not expect you to have any statistics programming knowledge.\nAccessing data For all assignments and in-class activities, I will house all of the links to the data on our class website, and I’ll place the relevant datasets on Canvas. For transparency, I will also point you to other GitHub repositories where available. If you’re new to Git or GitHub and want to understand some of that better, take a look at Grant McDermott’s notes on Data Science for Economists as well as Jenny Bryan’s online reference book, Happy Git and GitHub with R. But again, knowledge of Git or GitHub is not expected or required for this class.\nTurning things in All assignments should be submitted as PDF files on Canvas. Since we’ll be using some math in all of our answers, I suggest that assignments be completed through Overleaf. As an Emory student, everyone has access to an institutional Overleaf account, which provides you with all the nice features of the product. You can use this to easily write PDF documents in a language known as “LaTeX”. For a brief introductory video and links to more info, please see the video here. Overleaf is not a requirement, but I think it will save some you time in the long run. You are also welcome to use Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, etc., and convert to PDF for your final submission.\nThe only requirements are that your submission is a PDF and that your answers are legible and organized. Please DO NOT write tiny answers in margins of papers, scan as PDF, and submit. I will deduct some points for these types of submissions.\nCourse policies Be nice. Be honest. Don’t cheat.\nVarious policies for this course are described below. Basically, let’s all work to be good citizens and take seriously our various roles as a student, teacher, friend, colleague, human, etc.\nClass meetings All regular class meetings will take place in White Hall, Room 103 on Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30am to 12:45pm.\nOffice hours My designated office hours will be on Monday and Wednesday from 1:30 to 3:00pm in PAIS 573. I’m also available outside of these times. I just ask that you schedule an appointment in advance. Make an appointment with me here. While we call these “office hours” they really should be “student hours”. These are set times dedicated to all of you. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by with whatever questions you have. Take a look at this video for a more interesting presentation of what office hours really are and why you should come!\nFor any questions that you don’t think need a meeting, you can always reach out to me through email. I do my best to respond within 24 hours to all emails.\nAcademic integrity The Emory University Honor Code is taken seriously and governs all work in this course. Details about the Honor Code are available at Emory Honor Code. By taking this course, you affirm that it is a violation of the code to cheat on exams, to plagiarize, to deviate from the instructions about collaboration on work that is submitted for grades, to give false information to a faculty member, and to undertake any other form of academic misconduct. You agree that the teacher is entitled to move you to another seat during examinations, without explanation. You also affirm that if you witness others violating the code you have a duty to report them to the honor council.\nAccessibility services If you anticipate issues related to the format or requirements of this course, please meet with me. I would like us to discuss ways to ensure your full participation in the course. If you determine that accommodations are necessary, you may register with Accessibility Services at (404)727-9877 or via e-mail at accessibility@emory.edu. To register with OAS, students must self identify and initiate contact with the OAS office.\nClass-wide announcements I will post regular announcements to the class on Canvas, so please set up your notifications on Canvas accordingly. I will also use Canvas to post all grades and any other information that needs to stay in the class. All other course materials will be available on our class website, econ372s23.classes.ianmccarthyecon.com.\nLauren’s Promise I will listen and believe you if someone is threatening you.\nLauren McCluskey, a 21-year-old honors student athlete, was murdered on October 22, 2018 by a man she briefly dated on the University of Utah campus. We must all take action to ensure that this never happens again.\nIf you are in immediate danger, call 911 or Emory police (404-727-6111).\nAny form of sexual harassment or violence will not be excused or tolerated at Emory. If you are experiencing sexual assault, domestic violence, or stalking, please report it to me or directly to Emory’s Office of Respect (470-270-5360).\nAssignments and grades Detailed descriptions of all assignments are on the assignments page. Each assignment will contribute to your final grade as described below.\nAssignment Points Percent Weekly check-in 20 5% Homework (60 x 3) 180 45% Mid-term exam 60 15% Final project 140 35% Your final percentage grade comes from your total points as a percent of all possible points available in the class (400).

Assume that there exists a public insurer that pays a fixed price of \\(\\bar{p}=10\\).\nQuestion 1 How many private patients will the provider serve?\nThe practice will serve private insurance patients until the marginal revenue from those patients falls below the marginal revenue of a public patient. In this case, the marginal revenue of a public patient is \\(\\bar{p}=10\\). The Marginal revenue of a private practice is \\(16-2q\\). These are equal at \\(q=3\\). So the practice will see 3 private insurance patients.\nNote, we should check first that the practice will see any public patients. The way to do this is to make sure that the marginal revenue from a public patient is above the marginal revenue of \\(MR=MC\\) in the private market. In this case, \\(MR=MC\\) at \\(q=4\\) and \\(MR=8\\). This is below \\(\\bar{p}=10\\), so the practice will servce some portion of the public market whenever \\(\\bar{p}\u0026gt;8\\).\nQuestion 2 How many public patients?\nThe practice will see patients to the point where \\(MR=\\bar{p}=MC\\), which holds for \\(2q=10\\), or \\(q=5\\). Combined with our answer in part 1, the practice will see 3 private insurance patients and 2 public insurance patients.\nQuestion 3 What if \\(\\bar{p}\\) drops to $9.\nIn this case, the practice will again see total patients to the point where \\(MC=\\bar{p}\\). This holds for \\(2q=9\\), or \\(q=4.5\\). The practice will switch to the public market at \\(MR=\\bar{p}\\). This holds for \\(16-2q=9\\), or \\(q=3.5\\). So the drop in the fixed payment rate will lead to an increase in the number of private insurance patients seen (from 3 to 3.5), and a decrease in the number of public patients seen (from 2 to 1). The total number of patients seen in this case also decreases (from 5 to 4.5).\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"32a73d3baf343cbb9760f82fef24f4c1","permalink":"/resource/wksheet8/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resource/wksheet8/","section":"resource","summary":"Consider the firm’s inverse demand curve in the private insurance market, \\(d=16-q\\), and costs, \\(c(q)=5+q^{2}\\).
